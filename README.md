# Dotfiles

i'll clean this out and do further customisations and update this and stuffs if i remember

for now, everything lives in `fancy/` because i plan to make a more minimal config
in the not-so-distant future ^^

the configs i do have aren't particuarly riced or customised, just some minor tweaks.
i think they look somewhat coherent though.

do what you will with them.
